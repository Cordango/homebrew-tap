# The Cordango command line, as a Homebrew formula.
#
# THIS FILE BELONGS IN `cordango/homebrew-tap`, at `Formula/cordango.rb`. It is kept here so the
# canonical copy sits beside the workflow that produces the assets it points at.
#
# THE CHECKSUMS BELOW ARE ZEROS ON PURPOSE. They are of files that do not exist until the release is
# built, so this copy is the shape rather than the answer: `release.yml` runs `packaging/render.sh`
# over the real SHA256SUMS and attaches the finished formula to the release. Copy THAT into the tap.
# A formula carrying the previous release's checksums under this release's version would look
# finished and reject every download.
#
# A FORMULA RATHER THAN A CASK, deliberately. A cask is for .app bundles and installers, and Homebrew
# quarantines what a cask downloads — which is why unsigned casks make people run `brew trust` before
# anything will start. A formula extracts a tarball into the Cellar and is not quarantined, so an
# unsigned binary installed this way simply runs. That is what lets this ship before there is an
# Apple Developer ID to sign with.
